### TASK 1 : 
Use AWS S3 for hosting a static website that works as single interface to different social media applications. The website should have a login page and should accept only BITS sign-on
credentials and only after signing on a user will be directed to the Social media page.


-> We created an application that tracks the time spent on each social media site, the main learning was to be able to host a static website using S3.
